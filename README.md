THE MINIMALIST RECIPE CookBook


PROBLEM STATEMENT
  - A lot of young adults do not know how to prepare a decent meal because of the   nature of the modern lifestyle like school and work that takes alot of their time, unlike in the past where they are taught at home by the parents
  -There are people who have never been exposed to other cuisines apart from their local meals
SOLUTION STATEMENT
-Readily available recipes for inexperienced cooks at a click
-Expose more people to global or international cuisines

The main purpose of this HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT based project is to create a one page app or website that allows users to access hundreds of interesting recipes at a click.
The Minimalist Recipe gives an access to all recipes in the API.

My Expectations for users

-To view all the recipes without having to register
-To view all recipes in details
-And finally to get inspired and prepare enjoyabke meals

DESIGN
It's a user friendly
